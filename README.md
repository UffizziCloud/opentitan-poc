## About OpenTitan

[OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org) is an open source silicon Root of Trust
(RoT) project.  OpenTitan will make the silicon RoT design and implementation
more transparent, trustworthy, and secure for enterprises, platform providers,
and chip manufacturers.  OpenTitan is administered by [lowRISC
CIC](https://www.lowrisc.org) as a collaborative project to produce high
quality, open IP for instantiation as a full-featured product. See the
[OpenTitan site](https://opentitan.org/) and [OpenTitan
docs](https://docs.opentitan.org) for more information about the project.

## About OpenTitan on Uffizzi

This proof-of-concept is built as a prototype to run embedded systems on ephemeral environments powered by Uffizzi. These environments utilize the Dockerfile that comes with this project to install the software and hardware simulator on the ephemeral environment. A new ephemeral environment, with simulated OpenTitan hardware and OpenTitan software, will be spun-up for every PR opened against this repo. [Visit this blog](https://www.uffizzi.com/blog/simulated-ephemeral-cloud-environments-for-embedded-systems) to read about how these ephemeral environments for embedded systems work.

## About this Repository

Contains Uffizzi integration files to run OpenTitan on Uffizzi along with hardware, software and utilities written as part of the OpenTitan project.
